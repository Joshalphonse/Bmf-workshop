# Video Colorization with DeOldify/AI inferencing and BMF with: Workshop README

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Video Colorization with DeOldify and BMF" workshop! This workshop is designed to introduce participants to the fascinating world of video processing and colorization using Python, the DeOldify library, and the Babit Multi-Media Framework (BMF). Throughout this interactive session, you will gain hands-on experience in building a Python module that integrates DeOldify for colorizing black and white video frames, leveraging the capabilities of the BMF framework.

Whether you are a beginner in Python or have some experience in programming, this workshop is structured to enhance your understanding of video processing, machine learning applications in media, and the practical use of advanced Python libraries.

### Prerequisites

* Basic understanding of Python programming.
* Familiarity with basic concepts of video processing and neural networks (optional but helpful).
